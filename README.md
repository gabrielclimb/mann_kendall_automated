The idea of this project is automated the Mann Kendall Statistc for Well, commonly use in environment engineering and geology.
The core part of code was made by [Sat Kumar Tomer](http://vsp.pnnl.gov/help/Vsample/Design_Trend_Mann_Kendall.htm) and also adapt from [GSI SpreadSheet ](https://www.gsi-net.com/en/software/free-software/gsi-mann-kendall-toolkit.html).

The code is in **mann_kendall.py**, a example input table is **tabela.xlsx** and **kendall_dist.csv** is a table with value for normal curve that was extract from GSI cause it was a little different from those values usually used with numpy
